# Rice-Leaf-Disease-Detection
Convolutional neural network (CNN) model capable of accurately classifying three primary diseases that commonly afflict rice plants: leaf smut, bacterial blight, and brown spot.

### How to identify bacterial leaf blight on rice leaf?
- Check for wilting and yellowing of leaves, or wilting of seedlings (also called kresek).
- On seedlings, infected leaves turn greyish green and roll up.
- As the disease progresses, the leaves turn yellow to straw-coloured and wilt, leading whole seedlings to dry up and die.

### How to identify brown spot on rice leaf?
- Infected seedlings have small, circular, yellow brown or brown lesions that may girdle the coleoptile and distort primary and secondary leaves.
- Starting at tillering stage, lesions can be observed on the leaves. They are initially small, circular, and dark brown to purple-brown.
- Fully developed lesions are circular to oval with a light brown to grey centre, surrounded by a reddish brown margin caused by the toxin produced by the fungi.

### How to identify leaf smut on rice leaf?
- Leaf smut, caused by the fungus Entyloma oryzae, is a widely distributed, but somewhat minor, disease of rice.
- The fungus produces slightly raised, angular, black spots (sori) on both sides of the leaves.
- Although rare, it also can produce spots on leaf sheaths.
