# Rice-Leaf-Disease-Detection
Convolutional neural network (CNN) model capable of accurately classifying three primary diseases that commonly afflict rice plants: leaf blast, bacterial blight, and brown spot.

## How to identify bacterial leaf blight on rice leaf?
- Check for wilting and yellowing of leaves, or wilting of seedlings (also called kresek).
- On seedlings, infected leaves turn greyish green and roll up.
- As the disease progresses, the leaves turn yellow to straw-coloured and wilt, leading whole seedlings to dry up and die.
